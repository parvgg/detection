# detection
This code is a Python script using the Tkinter library to create a GUI application for object detection using the YOLOv5 model. Here's a summary of what the code does:

Imports necessary libraries including tkinter, customtkinter, torch, numpy, cv2 (OpenCV), and PIL.
Creates a Tkinter application window with dimensions 600x600 pixels and sets its title to "objectdet 4.0".
Defines a video frame (vidFrame) within the application window where the video stream will be displayed.
Initializes a counter variable and creates a label (counterLabel) to display the counter value.
Defines a function reset_counter() to reset the counter to zero.
Creates a button (resetButton) to trigger the reset_counter() function.
Loads a YOLOv5 model using torch.hub.load() from a specified path.
Opens the video capture device (webcam) using OpenCV.
Defines a function detect() to continuously capture frames from the webcam, perform object detection using the YOLOv5 model, update the counter based on detected objects, and update the video stream displayed in the GUI.
Inside the detect() function, it reads frames from the webcam, performs object detection using the YOLOv5 model, updates the counter if a specific object (with certain confidence and class) is detected, and updates the video stream displayed in the GUI.
The object detection results are continuously displayed in the video stream.
The app.mainloop() function starts the Tkinter event loop to run the application.
Note: Some lines of code related to playing audio files and importing the vlc library are commented out. These lines seem to be intended for playing audio alerts based on the detected objects but are currently disabled.
